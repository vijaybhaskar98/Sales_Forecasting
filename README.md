# 2. Data description
I've chosen Kaggle's Ecommerce dataset, portraying a typical supermart's records. With over half a million entries and 7 columns, it captures key transaction info. The first column holds unique INVOICE IDs, followed by STOCKCODE representing invoiced stocks, along with QUANTITY and UNITPRICE. INVOICEDATE is crucial for forecasting. CUSTOMERID and COUNTRY follow. DESCRIPTIONS provide stock details.
